#' Gets the operating system specific new line character(s)
#'
#' CR + LF on Windows, else only LF...
#'
#' The newline character(s) are determined once at package loading time.
#'
#' You normally don't need to care about this since "\\n" in strings works
#' on every platform (operating system) because it is converted automatically
#' when printed, saved in or loaded from a file.
#'
#' A typical use case is a unit test that compares an actual file
#' (eg. with "\\r\\n" on Windows) to an expected file that was eg. created on Linux
#' with "\\n" platform newline and you do byte compare of the files
#' (which will fail unless to "undo" the platform newline differences).
#'
#' @return the new line character(s) for the current operating system
#'
#' @export

#' platform.NewLine()
platform.NewLine <- function() {
