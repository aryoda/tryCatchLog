\title{Convert a call stack into a list of printable strings}
\usage{
limitedLabelsCompact(
  value,
  compact = FALSE,
  maxwidth = getOption("width") - 5L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{a list of calls ("call.stack") generated by \code{\link{sys.calls}}}

\item{compact}{if TRUE only calls that contain a source code reference (attribute "srcref") are returned
(plus always the first call); if FALSE all calls will be returned.}

\item{maxwidth}{Maximum number of characters per call in the return value (longer strings will be cutted).
Must be between 40 and 2000 (until version 1.2.2: 1000)}
}
\value{
A list of strings (one for each call).
                If \code{compact} is \code{TRUE} at the last call is returned even if it does not contain
                a source code reference.
}
\description{
Converts a call stack into a list of printable strings ("labels") with a limited length per call.
                If source code references are available they are also printed in the stack trace using this notation:
                \code{<file name>#<line number>: executed R expression (call)}
}
\details{
By default the maximum number of source code rows that are printed per call in the full stack trace
is 10. You can change this via the option \code{tryCatchLog.max.lines.per.call} (see example).

       R does track source code references only if you set the option "keep.source" to TRUE via
                \code{options(keep.source = TRUE)}. Without this option this function cannot enrich source code references.
                If you use \command{Rscript} to start a non-interactive R script as batch job you
                have to set this option since it is FALSE by default. You can add this option to your
                \link{.Rprofile} file or use a startup R script that sets this option and sources your
                actual R script then.

                This function is based on the undocumented \code{\link{limitedLabels}} function of the base package.
                The source code can be viewed by entering \code{limitedLabels} in the R console.
                The attributes required to add source file names and line numbers to the calls (srcref and srcfile)
                and how they are created internally are explained in this article:
                \url{https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-2/RJournal_2010-2_Murdoch.pdf}
