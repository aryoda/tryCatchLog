# Better error handling with the `tryCatchLog` package

## Installation

To install the package `tryCatchLog` from the source code use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("aryoda/tryCatchLog")
```

For more details see the Project site at: https://github.com/aryoda/tryCatchLog



## Overview

The `tryCatchLog` package improves the standard R's `try` and `tryCatch` functions by
offering extended functions:

| Condition handling strategy | Standard R    | tryCatchLog package |
|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Return an error object in case of errors | `try()` | `tryLog()` |
| Call condition handler functions | `tryCatch()` | `tryCatchLog()` |



**Improvements:**

1. Configurable **logging** ("for free")
2. Logging of full or compact **call stack** with line numbers
3. **Resume** after warnings and messages
4. Support for **post-mortem analysis** after errors via dump files



## `tryLog` example with an error

```{r, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tryCatchLog)   # load the package to avoid startup messages in the results later
```

Errors are logged but the execution continues after the `tryLog` call:

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning=F}
library(tryCatchLog)
f <- function(value) {
  print("begin")
  log(value)            # negative number -> warning; string -> error
  print("end")
}
tryLog(f("not a number"))
print("Errors don't stop me!")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## [1] "begin"
## ERROR [2016-12-06 21:44:21] non-numeric argument to mathematical function
## Compact call stack:
##   1 test.R#7: tryLog(f("not a number"))
##   2 tryCatchLog.R#345: tryCatchLog(expr = expr, write.error.dump.file = write.error.dump.file, error = function(e) {
##   3 tryCatchLog.R#259: tryCatch(withCallingHandlers(expr, error = function(e) {
##   4 test.R#4: .handleSimpleError(function (e)
## ...
## [1] "Errors don't stop me!"
```



## `tryLog` example with a warning



`tryLog` catches conditions and logs them onto console or into a file (depending of the settings of
the logging framework `futile.logger` that is used internally):

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning=F}
library(tryCatchLog)
f <- function(value) {
  print("begin")
  log(value)            # negative number -> warning; string -> error
  print("end")
}
tryLog(f(-1))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
## [1] "begin"
## WARN [2016-12-06 21:33:41] NaNs produced
## Compact call stack:
##   1 test.R#7: tryLog(f(-1))
##   2 tryCatchLog.R#345: tryCatchLog(expr = expr, write.error.dump.file = write.error.dump.file, error = function(e) {
##   3 tryCatchLog.R#259: tryCatch(withCallingHandlers(expr, error = function(e) {
##   4 test.R#4: .signalSimpleWarning("NaNs produced", quote(log(value)))
...
## [1] "end"
```



## `tryCatchLog` example to log and recover from an error

Use `tryCatchLog` to establish an error handler:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tryCatchLog)

send.email <- function(receiver, body) { }  # dummy function (does nothing)

tryCatchLog(log("not a number"),
            error = function(e) { send.email("admin@home", e)
            })
```

The console shows the log output then and the execution continues:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ERROR [2017-01-22 22:04:56] non-numeric argument to mathematical function
Compact call stack:
  1 tryCatchLog_error_example.R#5: tryCatchLog(log("not a number"), error = function(e) {
  2 tryCatchLog.R#273: tryCatch(withCallingHandlers(expr, error = function(e) {
...
```

**Note:** `send.email` is a dummy function for demonstration purposes!



## How to change the logging behaviour

To log to a file instead of the console or to change the logging level you call the usual `futile.logger` functions:

```{r eval = FALSE}
  library(futile.logger)

  flog.appender(appender.file("app.log"))

  flog.threshold(ERROR)    # TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL

  try(log(-1))             # the warning will not be logged!
```

# Post-mortem analysis



## Known limitations of interactive debugging in R

Interactive debugging using an IDE or the console is very difficult in case of

- errors that are not (easily) reproducible
- long running code that produces an error at the end
- batch jobs running on a server



## Solution: Post-mortem analysis

**Post-mortem analysis** means to create a dump file in case of an error that contains

- all objects of the global environment (workspace) and
- all objects within the scope of each called function (via `dump.frames`)

so that you can

- use any computer
- to load the dump file into a new R session
- after the script has stopped the execution (**"post-mortem"**) and
- examine the call stack and object values ("analysis")

to find out the reason for the error.



## Enable post-mortem analysis

`tryCatchLog` supports post-mortem analysis by creating dump files in case of errors:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tryCatchLog)
f <- function(value) {
  log(value)
}
a <- "100"
tryLog(f(a), write.error.dump.file = TRUE)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
ERROR [2016-12-12 22:29:52] non-numeric argument to mathematical function
Call stack environments dumped into file: dump_20161212_222952.rda
Compact call stack:
  1 source("~/R_trainings/tryCatchLog/src/test.R")
  2 test.R#6: tryLog(f(a), write.error.dump.file = TRUE)
  3 tryCatchLog.R#348: tryCatchLog(expr = expr, write.error.dump.file = write.error.dump.file, error = function(e) {
  4 tryCatchLog.R#262: tryCatch(withCallingHandlers(expr, error = function(e) {
  5 test.R#3: .handleSimpleError(function (e)
  ...
```



## Start a post-mortem analysis

Open a new R session and start the post-mortem analysis of the error:

```{r eval = FALSE}
load("dump_20161212_222952.rda")    # load the dump into the global environment
debugger(last.dump)                 # start the post-mortem analysis
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
Message:  non-numeric argument to mathematical functionAvailable environments had calls:
1: source("test.R")
...
5: test.R#6: tryLog(f(a), write.error.dump.file = TRUE)
6: tryCatchLog.R#348: tryCatchLog(expr = expr, write.error.dump.file = dump.erro
7: tryCatchLog.R#262: tryCatch(withCallingHandlers(expr, error = function(e) {
...
12: f(a)
13: test.R#3: .handleSimpleError(function (e)
14: h(simpleError(msg, call))

Enter an environment number, or 0 to exit
Selection: <Cursor is waiting for your input here>
```

The function call #13 shows: The error was thrown in the file `test.R` at line #3: `log(value)`



## Post-mortem debugging: Examine an environment

Switch into the environment of the function call #12 which called the function that throwed the error
and examine the objects visible within this function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
Enter an environment number, or 0 to exit
Selection: 12
Browsing in the environment with call:
   f(a)
Called from: debugger.look(ind)
Browse[1]> ls()
[1] "value"
Browse[1]> value
[1] "100"
Browse[1]> typeof(value)
[1] "character"
Browse[1]>
```

By looking at the (function argument) variable `value`
it is easy to identify the reason for the error: **The passed value "100" had the wrong data type!**

*You can exit the debugger now with "Q" (or "f" followed by "0") and fix the bug.*



## Post-mortem debugging: Limitations

R dump files (created with `save.image`) do **not** contain the loaded packages
when the dump file was created.

Therefore a dump loaded into memory later does **not** load these packages automatically.

**This means the program state as of the error is not exactly reproducible:**

- Objects that were stored within a package namespace are not available
- The search path to find objects may be different during post-mortem analysis
- You cannot step through your source code after loading the image
  if your source code calls functions of non-default packages. You have to load these packages manually
  before starting the debugger

# `tryCatchLog` Function Reference



## tryCatchLog()

Function signature:
```{r eval = FALSE}
tryCatchLog(expr, ..., finally = NULL,
  write.error.dump.file = getOption("tryCatchLog.write.error.dump.file", FALSE),
  silent.warnings       = getOption("tryCatchLog.silent.warnings", FALSE),
  silent.messages       = getOption("tryCatchLog.silent.messages", FALSE))
```

This function evaluates the expression in `expr` and passes all condition handlers in `...` to `tryCatch` as-is
while error, warning and message conditions are logged together with the function call stack
(including file names and line numbers).

The expression in `finally` is always evaluated at the end.

Warnings and messages can be "silenced" (only logged but not propagated to the caller) using the `silent.*` parameters.

The default values of some parameters can be set globally via `options` to avoid passing the same
parameter values in each call and to support easy reconfiguration for all calls without changing the code.



## tryLog()

Function signature:
```{r eval = FALSE}
tryLog(expr,
  write.error.dump.file = getOption("tryCatchLog.write.error.dump.file", FALSE),
  silent.warnings       = getOption("tryCatchLog.silent.warnings", FALSE),
  silent.messages       = getOption("tryCatchLog.silent.messages", FALSE))
```

This function is a short version of `tryCatchLog()`
that traps any errors that occur during the evaluation of the expression `expr`
without stopping the execution of the script (similar to `try` in R).
Errors, warnings and messages are logged.

In contrast to `tryCatchLog()` it returns an object of the class "try-error"
in case of an error and continues after the `tryLog` expression.
Therefore `tryLog` does not support the `error` and `finally` parameters
for passing custom handler functions.

The default values of some parameters can be set globally via `options` to avoid passing the same
parameter values in each call and to support easy reconfiguration for all calls without changing the code.



## Change global options of `tryCatchLog`

The default values of many options can be changed globally by configuring them once
to reduce lengthy function calls later and support easy reconfiguration for all calls
without changing the code:

```{r results = "hide"}
# Initialize your own default values globally for tryLog and tryCatchLog
options(tryCatchLog.write.error.dump.file = FALSE)
options(tryCatchLog.silent.messages       = TRUE)
options(tryCatchLog.silent.warnings       = TRUE)

test <- function() {
  message("hello")
  warning("a warning")
}

# Use your own default values by ommiting those parameters...
tryLog(f())

# .. instead of the longer version which passes each parameter again and again
tryLog(f(), silent.warnings=TRUE, silent.messages=TRUE, write.error.dump.file=FALSE)
```




# `tryCatchLog` Best Practices



## Easiest way to add logging of all conditions

Just wrap the call to the main function or main script with `tryCatchLog()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(futile.logger)
library(tryCatchLog)

options(keep.source = TRUE)        # source code file name and line number tracking
options("tryCatchLog.write.error.dump.file" = TRUE) # dump for post-mortem analysis

flog.appender(appender.file("my_app.log"))  # to log into a file instead of console
flog.threshold(INFO)    # TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL

tryCatchLog(source("your_main_script.R"))
```



## Enabling source code references (file names and line numbers)

To show **file names and line numbers** in the stack trace of the log output:

* For R script files

    R does track source code references of scripts only if you set `options(keep.source = TRUE)` before.

    If you use `Rscript` to start a non-interactive R script as batch job you
    have to set this option since it is FALSE by default.

    You can add this option to your `.Rprofile` file or use a startup R script as stub to set this option


* For installed packages

    By default, most packages are built without source reference information.
    Setting the environment variable `R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE=yes` before installing a source package
    will tell R to keep the source references.
  
    You can also use set `{options(keep.source.pkgs = TRUE)` before you install a package.
